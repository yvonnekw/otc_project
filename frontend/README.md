# Frontend

### Install and Compile

Run these commands to install and view the frontend pages:

`npm install`

Utilise the website as:

`npm run dev`

Proceed to visit the website at http://localhost:2000 if everything is in order.

### Build the frontend application in preparation for deployment

You must use the following command to create the frontend in order to accomplish this:

`npm run build`

All the files will be compiled into the dist folder as a result. This is what Docker will utilise to build the image for the docker compose.

For information on how to deploy the application, see the README.md file in the backend directory.
